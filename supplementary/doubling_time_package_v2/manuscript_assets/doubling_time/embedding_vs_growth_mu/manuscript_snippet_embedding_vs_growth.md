## Exploratory embedding–growth analysis (auto-generated)

- n=12 strains with WT RbcL embeddings and best-case doubling-time labels.
- LOOCV Ridge(PCA) on pooled ESM2 embeddings predicting `mu_per_h`:
  - Spearman ρ = 0.82, R² = 0.54.
- Interpretation: hypothesis-generating only (small n; doubling time is condition- and physiology-dependent).
